# Data Driven Approach to Forecasting and Managing Flight Delays

This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict flight delays using the 2018 U.S. Department of Transportation dataset. With over 7 million records, the project aims to classify flights delayed by more than 15 minutes, providing actionable insights for the aviation industry to improve operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Framework**: 
  - Implemented a multi-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture with advanced regularization techniques such as L2 regularization, batch normalization, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
  - Optimized the model using Adam optimizer, early stopping, and dynamic learning rate adjustments for robust training.

- **Advanced Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted temporal features like day of the week and month to capture seasonal and daily patterns.
  - Conducted Random Forest-based feature importance analysis to identify critical predictors such as carrier-specific delays, departure delays, and flight duration.
  - Performed correlation analysis to remove redundant features and improve model interpretability.

- **Imbalanced Data Handling**:
  - Tackled the issue of class imbalance (majority on-time flights vs. minority delayed flights) using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and class-weighted loss functions.
  - Improved the modelâ€™s sensitivity to minority class predictions (delayed flights).

- **Model Comparisons**:
  - Evaluated three models: Logistic Regression (baseline), Decision Tree, and Deep Neural Network (DNN).
  - The DNN outperformed other models with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics for the year 2018. It contains over 7 million records with features such as:
- Flight schedules and delays
- Weather conditions
- Carrier-specific delays
- Airport and route information

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
   - Created binary classification for delays (>15 minutes delayed as 1, otherwise 0).

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted temporal and operational features.
   - Applied Random Forest to analyze feature importance and reduce dimensionality.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented a Logistic Regression model as the baseline.
   - Built a Decision Tree for better interpretability of non-linear relationships.
   - Designed and fine-tuned a DNN for superior accuracy and predictive performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compared model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Conducted error analysis to identify and improve areas of misclassification.

## Results

- Achieved high prediction accuracy and recall for delayed flights using the DNN.
- Identified key delay predictors such as:
  - Departure delays
  - Carrier-specific delays
  - Seasonal trends (month/day patterns)
- The DNN demonstrated scalability and adaptability to other datasets or real-time inputs.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  - Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Incorporate live weather, airport traffic, and operational data to improve real-world applicability.
- **Advanced Imbalanced Data Techniques**: Experiment with advanced methods like anomaly detection and ensemble techniques to enhance minority class prediction.
- **Interpretability**: Use techniques like SHAP and LIME to provide insights into deep learning model decisions.
