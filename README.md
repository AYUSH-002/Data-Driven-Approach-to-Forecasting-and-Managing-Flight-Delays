# Data-Driven Approach to Forecasting and Managing Flight Delays
This project presents a data-driven approach to predicting flight delays using machine learning and deep learning techniques on the 2018 U.S. Department of Transportation dataset, consisting of over 7 million records. The goal was to accurately classify flights delayed by more than 15 minutes and provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency in the aviation industry.

Key Features:
Deep Learning Framework:
Designed and implemented a multi-layer deep neural network (DNN) architecture featuring L2 regularization, batch normalization, and dropout layers to capture complex relationships while preventing overfitting. The model was optimized using the Adam optimizer with early stopping and dynamic learning rate adjustments.

Extensive Feature Engineering:
Performed advanced preprocessing techniques, including temporal feature extraction (e.g., day of the week, month), Random Forest-based feature importance analysis, and removal of redundant or highly correlated features to enhance model performance.

Handling Imbalanced Data:
Addressed the class imbalance problem (majority on-time flights vs. minority delayed flights) by employing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and class-weighted loss functions to improve the model’s ability to predict delays.

Model Comparisons:
Evaluated three models—Logistic Regression (baseline), Decision Tree, and Deep Neural Network. The DNN outperformed others with higher accuracy, ROC-AUC scores, and recall metrics, showcasing its robustness in handling complex datasets.

Results:
Achieved high accuracy and recall, ensuring reliable predictions of delayed flights.
Demonstrated scalability and adaptability to other datasets or real-time data inputs.
Insights from feature importance analysis revealed significant predictors such as departure delay, carrier-specific delays, and temporal patterns.
This project provides a scalable solution for proactive delay management, enabling airlines and airports to optimize operations, enhance passenger experience, and reduce costs.
